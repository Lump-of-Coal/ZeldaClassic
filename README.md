 # Zelda Classic

Zelda Classic is an engine for making games similar to the original Famicom/NES 'Legend of Zelda' title from 1986, but can be used to create anything from that to a wholly custom game engine , much like commercial software such as PICO-8 or Gamemaker. The packages include the custom, C, C, Pascal, and Ruby-inspired, powerful scripting language: ZScript, that allows you to directly modify the game engine to the limits of your imagination, creativity, and programming expertise.

## Development

For information on contributing to this project, please read: [`docs/building.md`](./docs/building.md).

Zelda Classic builds Allegro 5 from source. The code base still uses Allegro 4 APIs, but uses [Allegro-Legacy](https://github.com/NewCreature/Allegro-Legacy) to translate into Allegro 5.

The compiled binaries require a number of resource files to be available at runtime. By default, building the project will copy those files to the correct location. They will only be copied if they do not already existâ€“so you can modify these files (like the various `.cfg` files) in your build directory to your liking. To completely refresh the resources file, build the `copy_resources` target (ex: `cmake --build build -t copy_resources`)

Logs are written to `allegro.log`.

We have dozens of replay tests (`tests/replays/*.zplay`), which are text files that have recorded inputs of actual gameplay. To avoid regressions, we play this input back to the game engine, and in CI make sure that every single frame is drawn as expected. This command will run a single replay:

```sh
python3 tests/run_replay_tests.py --filter tests/replays/classic_1st.zplay
```

See [`docs/replays.md`](./docs/replays.md) for more.
